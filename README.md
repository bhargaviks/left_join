You've been given two files employee_names.csv and employee_pay.csv. These files are related by the id field. 

The goal is to implement the logic of a **left join** (it should give the same results if you were to load the data into a database and perform a left join).

The fields to be included in the output are below

id
first_name
last_name
salary
bonus
